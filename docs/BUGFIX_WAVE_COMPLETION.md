# Bug Fix: Wave Not Completing

## Issue
Wave 1 never completes even after all enemies leave the map.

## Root Cause
When a **Stealer** successfully returns corn to spawn, it was:
1. ✅ Setting `hasReachedEnd = true`
2. ✅ Destroying the GameObject
3. ❌ **NOT notifying EnemyManager** that the enemy is complete

This caused the wave system to still track the stealer as "active" even though it was destroyed.

## The Fix

### Before (ReturnToSpawn method):
```csharp
if (distanceToSpawn < 0.5f)
{
    CornManager.Instance.RegisterCornSteal(this);
    Debug.Log($"{name} successfully returned corn to spawn!");
    
    hasReachedEnd = true;
    Destroy(gameObject);  // ❌ No notification to EnemyManager!
}
```

### After (ReturnToSpawn method):
```csharp
if (distanceToSpawn < 0.5f)
{
    CornManager.Instance.RegisterCornSteal(this);
    Debug.Log($"{name} successfully returned corn to spawn!");
    
    hasReachedEnd = true;
    OnEnemyReachedEnd?.Invoke(this);           // ✅ Notify event listeners
    EnemyManager.Instance?.OnEnemyReachedEnd(this);  // ✅ Notify manager
    
    Destroy(gameObject);
}
```

## Comparison with Normal Enemy Completion

Both paths now follow the same pattern:

### Regular Attacker (ReachEnd method):
```csharp
private void ReachEnd()
{
    hasReachedEnd = true;
    
    GameManager.Instance?.ModifyHealth(-enemyData.damageToPlayer);
    
    OnEnemyReachedEnd?.Invoke(this);           // Notify listeners
    EnemyManager.Instance?.OnEnemyReachedEnd(this);  // Notify manager
    
    Destroy(gameObject);
}
```

### Corn Stealer (ReturnToSpawn method):
```csharp
// When reaching spawn with corn
hasReachedEnd = true;

CornManager.Instance.RegisterCornSteal(this);  // Stealer-specific

OnEnemyReachedEnd?.Invoke(this);           // Notify listeners
EnemyManager.Instance?.OnEnemyReachedEnd(this);  // Notify manager

Destroy(gameObject);
```

## What This Fixes

✅ **Wave completion now works correctly**
- EnemyManager properly tracks stealer completion
- Wave ends when all enemies are dead OR reached end
- Next wave can start properly

✅ **Consistent with existing patterns**
- Follows same notification pattern as `ReachEnd()`
- All enemy types properly notify systems on completion

✅ **No side effects**
- Corn stealing still works
- Stats tracking still accurate
- Event listeners still fire

## Testing Verification

After this fix, you should see:

1. **Wave 1 starts** → Enemies spawn
2. **Stealers grab corn** → Return to spawn
3. **Console log:** `"EnemyBasic(Clone) successfully returned corn to spawn!"`
4. **Wave completes** → UI shows "Wave Complete" or next wave starts
5. **No stuck waves** → Game progresses normally

## Related Files Modified

- `Assets/Scripts/Enemy/Enemy.cs` (line ~838)
  - Method: `ReturnToSpawn()`
  - Added: `OnEnemyReachedEnd?.Invoke(this)`
  - Added: `EnemyManager.Instance?.OnEnemyReachedEnd(this)`

## Impact

**Affected Systems:**
- ✅ Wave Management (now completes properly)
- ✅ Enemy Tracking (accurate count)
- ✅ Statistics (kill/completion counts)
- ✅ Event System (listeners notified)

**Not Affected:**
- Corn theft mechanics (unchanged)
- Enemy AI behavior (unchanged)
- Combat system (unchanged)
- Tower targeting (unchanged)

## Why This Happened

This bug occurred because the corn theft system was added as a new feature to existing enemy code. The `ReturnToSpawn()` method was created fresh and didn't include the manager notification that the original `ReachEnd()` method had.

**Key Lesson:** When creating alternate completion paths for game entities, always ensure they follow the same notification/cleanup pattern as the original completion method.

## Prevention

To avoid similar issues in the future:

1. **Check existing completion methods** when adding new completion paths
2. **Use the same notification pattern** across all completion scenarios
3. **Test wave completion** after adding new enemy behaviors
4. **Look for manager notification calls** in similar methods

## Quick Test

To verify the fix works:

```
1. Start game
2. Start Wave 1
3. Wait for enemies to complete (attack or steal)
4. Verify wave UI updates (e.g., "Wave 1 Complete")
5. Verify next wave can start
```

**Success indicators:**
- ✅ Wave counter increments
- ✅ UI shows completion message
- ✅ Next wave starts when ready
- ✅ No "stuck" waiting for enemies

**Status:** ✅ FIXED (as of October 18, 2025)
