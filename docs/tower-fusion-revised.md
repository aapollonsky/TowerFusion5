## üÉè Streamlined Trait System

### Tier 1 Traits (Always Safe)
**Elemental Package**
- **Fire**: +50% damage, burn DoT (3 seconds)
- **Ice**: -30% enemy speed, brittle effect (+25% incoming damage)
- **Lightning**: Chain to 2 additional enemies

**Range Package**  
- **Sniper**: +100% range, +2 second charge time
- **Scatter**: 90¬∞ cone attack, -25% single-target damage
- **Seeker**: Projectiles track enemies, -15% damage

**Utility Package**
- **Barrier**: Blocks enemy path temporarily (30 seconds cooldown)
- **Harvest**: +1 gold per kill
- **Amplify**: +15% damage to nearby towers

### Tier 2 Traits (10% Corruption Risk)
Can only be applied to towers with existing Tier 1 traits. Examples:
- **Overcharge** (Fire + Lightning): Explosive chain reactions
- **Permafrost** (Ice + Barrier): Freezes enemies in place
- **Seeking Storm** (Lightning + Seeker): Homing chain lightning

### Tier 3 Traits (25% Corruption Risk, Unlocked Wave 15+)
Experimental combinations that create unique tower archetypes:
- **Void Rift** (Any 3 traits): Creates dimensional tear that damages all enemies
- **Living Tower** (Support + Utility + Any): Tower gains AI behavior

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Simplified Corruption Mechanics

### Corruption States
**Stable (80-100%)**: Normal operation, visual pristine
**Unstable (50-79%)**: Occasional sparks, 5% misfire chance  
**Volatile (25-49%)**: Heavy glitching, 15% misfire, visual distortion
**Critical (1-24%)**: 30% misfire, spreads instability to adjacent towers
**Rogue (0%)**: Attacks randomly, becomes elite enemy after 45 seconds

### Corruption Management Tools
**Stabilizer Kit** (Craftable): Restores 25% stability to one tower
**Emergency Shutdown** (Free): Removes all traits, resets to base tower
**Containment Field** (Purchasable): Prevents corruption spread for 3 waves

### Corruption Benefits
- Volatile towers deal +100% damage on successful hits
- Critical towers generate double resources
- Rogue towers become allied units if you survive their betrayal

The progressive unlocking system ensures players can master each layer before encountering the next, while the ethical monetization model positions the game as a premium experience in an increasingly crowded mobile market.

The key to success lies in **execution quality** over **feature quantity** ‚Äî delivering a polished, accessible experience that gradually reveals its depth rather than overwhelming players with options from the start. By focusing on the player's journey from confusion to mastery, Tower Fusion Draft can achieve both commercial success and critical acclaim as a genuinely innovative entry in the tower defense genre.

*Ready to turn chaos into strategy, one trait at a time ‚Äî without accidentally corrupting your entire defense on Wave 2.*

I can see that it mentions 2 basic tower types (Damage, Support) in Phase 1, then adds a third type (Utility) in Phase 2. Let me analyze what these tower types would likely be based on the game design:

Damage Towers (Primary offensive units)
Archer Tower
Base Stats: Medium damage, medium range, medium attack speed
Projectile Type: Arrows that travel in straight lines
Role: Reliable single-target damage, good for most enemy types
Cost: Low (starter tower)
Cannon Tower
Base Stats: High damage, short range, slow attack speed
Projectile Type: Explosive cannonballs with small area damage
Role: High burst damage, effective against armored enemies
Cost: High (specialized damage dealer)
Crossbow Tower
Base Stats: High damage, long range, very slow attack speed
Projectile Type: Bolts with piercing capability
Role: Sniper-style precision damage, good for priority targets
Cost: Medium-high
Support Towers (Force multipliers and utility)
Aura Tower
Base Stats: No direct damage
Effect: Provides damage/speed buffs to nearby towers in radius
Role: Enhances other towers' effectiveness
Cost: Medium (investment that pays off with multiple towers)
Slow Tower
Base Stats: Very low damage, medium range, fast attack speed
Effect: Slows enemy movement speed for duration
Role: Crowd control, gives other towers more time to attack
Cost: Low-medium
Shield Tower
Base Stats: No damage
Effect: Projects barrier that blocks enemy movement temporarily
Role: Path manipulation, emergency crowd control
Cost: Medium
Utility Towers (Unlocked Phase 2)
Gold Mine
Base Stats: No damage
Effect: Generates gold over time
Role: Economic advantage for more tower building
Cost: High (long-term investment)
Radar Tower
Base Stats: No damage, very long range
Effect: Reveals invisible enemies, extends range of nearby towers
Role: Detection and range enhancement
Cost: Medium
How They Work Together
Based on the spec's trait system, here are some synergies:

Early Game Combinations (Phase 1-2)
Archer + Fire Trait: Becomes flame archer with burn DoT
Cannon + Lightning Trait: Explosive shots that chain to nearby enemies
Aura Tower + Amplify Trait: Boosts become even stronger (+15% more damage)
Slow Tower + Ice Trait: Freezing effects that also make enemies brittle
Advanced Combinations (Phase 3+)
Crossbow + Sniper Trait: Extreme range precision shots with charge time
Shield Tower + Barrier Trait: Enhanced blocking with longer duration
Gold Mine + Harvest Trait: Generates gold from passive income AND kills nearby
Design Rationale
The spec emphasizes progressive complexity, so:

Phase 1: Players learn with just Archer (damage) and Aura (support) towers
Phase 2: Add Cannon/Crossbow for damage variety, Slow tower for active support
Phase 3: Full roster with specialized utilities
This matches the 60-second rule mentioned in the spec - players can quickly understand "damage tower shoots enemies, support tower helps damage tower" without overwhelming complexity.

The trait system then transforms these simple bases into the complex, specialized towers that create the roguelike variety the game is designed around.
