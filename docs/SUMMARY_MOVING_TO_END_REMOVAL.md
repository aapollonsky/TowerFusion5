# Summary: MovingToEnd State Removal

## What Was Done

Removed the `MovingToEnd` behavior state from the enemy AI system to align with the corn theft game objective.

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `Assets/Scripts/Enemy/Enemy.cs`
  - Removed `MovingToEnd` from `EnemyBehaviorState` enum
  - Updated `ConvertToStealer()` to call `Die()` instead of moving to end when no corn
  - Updated `Update()` switch to remove `MovingToEnd` case
  - Updated `UpdateTowerTargeting()` to convert to stealer instead of moving to end
  - Updated `HandleTowerBehavior()` to remove `MovingToEnd` case
  - Marked `MoveAlongPath()` and `ReachEnd()` as deprecated
  - **5 locations changed**

### Created
- `docs/REMOVAL_MOVING_TO_END.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `docs/QUICKREF_NO_MOVING_TO_END.md` - Quick reference guide

## New Enemy Behavior

### Attackers (85% of enemies)
```
Spawn → Seek Tower → Attack Tower → Destroy Tower → Convert to Stealer → Steal Corn
```

If no towers found:
```
Spawn → Seek Tower → (none found) → Convert to Stealer → Steal Corn
```

### Stealers (15% of enemies)
```
Spawn → Move to Corn → Grab Corn → Return to Spawn
```

## Key Changes

1. **No more path following to end** - Enemies never walk to the end anymore
2. **Automatic conversion** - Attackers become stealers when towers destroyed or no towers found
3. **Die when no corn** - If no corn available and no towers, enemy dies instead of moving to end
4. **Continuous tower seeking** - Attackers now scan for towers continuously (fixed in previous update)

## Impact

- **Game Objective:** Now 100% focused on corn defense
- **Player Health:** No longer damaged by enemies reaching end
- **Win Condition:** Complete all waves with corn remaining
- **Loss Condition:** All corn successfully stolen

## Testing Status

✅ Compiles without errors  
✅ All references to `MovingToEnd` removed  
✅ Deprecated methods marked  
✅ Documentation created  

## Next Steps

Test in Unity:
1. Place towers near spawn
2. Place towers near corn pile
3. Verify attackers seek and attack both
4. Verify conversion to stealer after tower destroyed
5. Verify stealers ignore towers and go for corn
6. Verify game ends when corn stolen or waves complete
