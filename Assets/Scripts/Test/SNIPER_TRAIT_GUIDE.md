# Sniper Trait Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Sniper trait has been fully implemented with the following mechanics:
- **+100% range** (doubles attack range)
- **+2 second charge time** (tower must charge before firing)

## How It Works

### Range Enhancement
- Base tower range is multiplied by 2.0x
- Visual range indicator shows both original (red) and extended (green) ranges
- Tower can target enemies at extended range

### Charge Time Mechanics
- When a target enters range, tower begins charging
- Charging takes 2 seconds (configurable via `chargeTimeBonus`)
- Tower shows charging progress visually
- If target moves out of range, charging is canceled
- Once charged, tower fires immediately and resets

## Testing the Sniper Trait

### Method 1: Using SniperTraitTest Component
1. **Add component**: Add `SniperTraitTest` to any GameObject in scene
2. **Assign tower**: Drag a tower to "Test Tower" field
3. **Use context menu options**:
   - **"Apply Sniper Trait"** - Adds sniper trait to tower
   - **"Setup Long Range Target"** - Positions enemy at extended range
   - **"Test Sniper Attack"** - Tests charging behavior
   - **"Remove All Traits"** - Cleans up for retesting

### Method 2: Manual Testing
1. Place a tower in the scene
2. Apply Sniper trait via TowerTraitManager
3. Position enemies at different distances to test range and charging

## Visual Indicators

### Gizmos (Scene View)
- **Red circle**: Original tower range
- **Green circle**: Extended range with Sniper trait
- **Yellow progress bar**: Charge progress when tower is charging

### Inspector Values (SniperTraitTest component)
- **Sniper Trait Applied**: Shows if trait is active
- **Original Range**: Base tower range
- **Modified Range**: Range with trait applied
- **Charge Time**: Current charge time setting
- **Is Charging**: Real-time charging status
- **Charge Progress**: 0-1 progress value

### Console Messages
```
[TowerName]: Started charging (charge time: 2s)
[TowerName]: Charge complete, firing!
[TowerName]: Target lost, canceling charge
```

## Expected Behavior

### Range Testing
1. **Without Sniper trait**: Tower attacks enemies within base range
2. **With Sniper trait**: Tower can target enemies at 2x the original range
3. **Range visualization**: Green circle shows extended targeting area

### Charge Testing
1. **Enemy enters range**: Tower starts charging (yellow progress bar appears)
2. **During charge**: Tower does not fire, progress bar fills over 2 seconds
3. **Charge complete**: Tower fires immediately, progress bar disappears
4. **Target lost**: Charging cancels, must restart when new target acquired

### Attack Pattern
1. **Normal towers**: Attack immediately when cooldown expires
2. **Sniper towers**: Must complete 2-second charge before each shot
3. **Cooldown**: Normal attack speed cooldown applies AFTER charging

## Configuration

### Trait Parameters
```csharp
trait.rangeMultiplier = 2f;      // +100% range
trait.chargeTimeBonus = 2f;      // +2 second charge time
trait.overlayColor = Color.green; // Visual indicator
```

### Customization
- Modify `chargeTimeBonus` to change charge duration
- Adjust `rangeMultiplier` to change range enhancement
- Visual effects can be enhanced in the Tower class

## Troubleshooting

### Sniper Not Charging
- **Check trait application**: Verify trait is in AppliedTraits list
- **Check target**: Enemy must be within range and alive
- **Check console**: Look for "Started charging" messages

### Range Not Extended
- **Check trait stats**: Verify `rangeMultiplier = 2f`
- **Check visual range**: Compare red (original) vs green (extended) circles
- **Test targeting**: Place enemy between original and extended range

### Charging Cancellation
- **Target movement**: Enemy moving out of range cancels charge
- **Target death**: Dead enemies cancel charging
- **Normal behavior**: Charge resets after each shot

## Performance Notes
- Charge time is calculated per-shot, not continuously
- Visual updates only occur during charging state
- No performance impact when trait is not applied
- Gizmos only render in Scene view, not in build

## Integration Points
- **TowerTraitManager**: Calculates modified stats including charge time
- **Tower.TryAttack()**: Implements charging logic
- **Tower properties**: Expose charging state for UI/effects
- **Visual system**: Range circles and progress indicators
